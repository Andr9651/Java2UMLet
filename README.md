# Java2UMLet
A very simple and naive interpreter that converts .java files to text formatted for  "Design Class Diagrams" in UMLet.

its not very good, but it works to speed up the process.

Just select a java file or folder containing java files and it will process and save the file(s) to "currentUser"\Java2UMLet.
It will also fill your clipboard with the most recently converted java file.
